I'm currently a freelance marketing consultant, mainly for B2B SaaS companies. I have been in charge of growth & marketing for a few busineses, including [WP Curve](https://www.wpcurve.com) leading up to their sale to GoDaddy. Here are some articles that will give you an idea of the work that I have done:
